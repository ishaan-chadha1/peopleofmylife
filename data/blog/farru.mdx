## Introduction

How's it going Mr.Visionary? This is the place where I get to brag about you to anyone else reading this, so let's get started. I love that we were both able to agree that we both have a place on the spectrum and honeslty I think that is one of the main reasons why it works between us.
The best thing about our relationship is that even though it started in a professional capacity, I know that we are going to be friends for life. If our first "professional" relationship does not work out, I know for a fact we are both going to try again and again and again until we make it work
out. I won't meet you at the top, because i'm certain that we will make it to the top together.

## Mr.Jobs
