## Introduction

Hey man, how's it going? Hope you're doing well. The intro for these pages is usually used for me to brag about how cool you are and how lucky I am to have someone like you in my life. I'm so happy that I made the decision to take the trek with my dad because I was not only able to meet amazing people like you, but with youre help I was able to get my life in track and get my relationship with my dad going in the right direction.

## Thank You

## A trip to remember for a lifetime and beyond

I have to call you the coolest adult I have ever met because I didnt think conversations like what I was lucky enough to have with you were
possible unless me and the other person were atleast a similar age. I was able to talk and express views I had so openly and without being
scared of judgement. You were able to open my eyes to understand the wisdom that I can get from people elder to me and people in general.
Up until now, whenever I respected a person this much, I would've never felt comfortable being myself and expressing my inner emotions and
thoughts. I was able to feel completely comfortable in expressing any sort of thought or emotion I felt during any interaction I was lucky
enough to have with you. There are a lot of other things which I need to thank you for, but thank you for allowing me to be my true self
while talking to you. After all our lovely conversations, I truly began to wonder if I have ever even had a completely open conversation with anyone
ever before.

## The Rock

So the rock is kind of a cool story. When I was at Everest Base Camp, I had met a small kid who was collecting rocks. I asked him why was he doing that and he said he was going to give a rock back
to each person who has a piece of his heart. I found that extremely beautiful and did the same thing. I was able to find a peice of my self and my heart through the time I was lucky enough to spend
with you, so you will always continue to exist in my heart. I can now go to that peice of my heart whenever I need to have a cool conversation and truly be myself.

## Thank you for showing me how strong you are through your actions.

## Thank you for inspiring me to become a better person.

## Thank you for showing me that men are allowed to have emotions.

## Thank you for being a peice of my heart.

## I am eterally grateful for the guidance, wisdom and knowledge that God decided to impart on me through you.
