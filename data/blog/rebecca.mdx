## Introduction

The Introduction is usually a place for me to brag about how cool this person is or how much this person means to me. In this case, the introduction would probably go on for ever, because of how cool this person is and how much they mean to me. God gave me the honour and pleasure to meet Rebecca Mathai during my trek to Ali Bedni Bugayal, June 2024. Now, unless you are the coolest person I have ever met, you have to leave because the rest of this article is not meant for you.

## Thank You

## A trip to remember for a lifetime and beyond

I have to call you the coolest adult I have ever met because I didnt think conversations like what I was lucky enough to have with you were
possible unless me and the other person were atleast a similar age. I was able to talk and express views I had so openly and without being
scared of judgement. You were able to open my eyes to understand the wisdom that I can get from people elder to me and people in general.
Up until now, whenever I respected a person this much, I would've never felt comfortable being myself and expressing my inner emotions and
thoughts. I was able to feel completely comfortable in expressing any sort of thought or emotion I felt during any interaction I was lucky
enough to have with you. There are a lot of other things which I need to thank you for, but thank you for allowing me to be my true self
while talking to you. After all our lovely conversations, I truly began to wonder if I have ever even had a completely open conversation with anyone
ever before.

## The Rock

So the rock is kind of a cool story. When I was at Everest Base Camp, I had met a small kid who was collecting rocks. I asked him why was he doing that and he said he was going to give a rock back
to each person who has a piece of his heart. I found that extremely beautiful and did the same thing. I was able to find a peice of my self and my heart through the time I was lucky enough to spend
with you, so you will always continue to exist in my heart. I can now go to that peice of my heart whenever I need to have a cool conversation and truly be myself.

## Thank you for showing me how strong you are through your smile.

## Thank you for inspiring me beyond words.

## Thank you for being a peice of my heart.

## I am eterally grateful for the guidance, wisdom and knowledge that God decided to impart on me through you.
