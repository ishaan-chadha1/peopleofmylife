## Introduction

The Introduction is usually a place for me to brag about how cool this person is or how much this person means to me. In this case, the introduction would probably go on for ever, because of how cool this person is and how much they mean to me. God gave me the honour and pleasure to meet Rebecca Mathai during my trek to Ali Bedni Bugayal, June 2024. Now, unless you are the coolest person I have ever met, you have to leave because the rest of this article is not meant for you. 
## Thank You
